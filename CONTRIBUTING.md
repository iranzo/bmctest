# CONTRIBUTING

- We use [commitizen-style](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) commits.
- We also use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook for validation of commits.

With above, automated release process via GitHub actions is available.

Feel free to fork, expand and PR-back your changes so that once merged will automatically trigger a new release.

Remember to execute `pre-commit install` on your repository checkout so that the hook is executed each time before pushing new changes so that CI errors are avoided.
